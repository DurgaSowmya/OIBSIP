              <strong>Narendra Damodardas Modi</strong> born 17 September
              1950.is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th Prime
              Minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the Chief Minister of
              Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for
              Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and
              of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu
              nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the
              longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National
              Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat,
              where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to
              the RSS at age eight. His account of helping his father sell tea
              at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably
              corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom
              he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four
              decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a
              full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned
              him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the
              party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general
              secretary

            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <p>
              Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967;
              his teachers described him as an average student and a keen,
              gifted debater with an interest in theatre He preferred playing
              larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has
              influenced his political image When Modi was eight years old, he
              was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began
              attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, he met
              Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a balswayamsevak (junior
              cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was
              training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and
              Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped
              found the BJP's Gujarat unit

              Modi spent the following two years travelling across northern and
              north-eastern India. In interviews, he has described visiting
              Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near
              Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission
              in Rajkot. His stays at each ashram were brief because he lacked
              the required college education. Vivekananda has had a large
              influence in Modi's life In 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts
              degree in political science from the School of Open Learning at
              the Delhi University. graduating with a third class. In 1983, he
              received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat
              University, graduating with a first class as an external distance
              learning student. There is a controversy surrounding his
              educational qualification.
